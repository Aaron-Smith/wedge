		Styling type.
		Possible values:
			add (default, add this styling to the root style)
			replace (discard the root style and consider this as the basic style)
		Warnings:
			- If you use "replace", make sure to copy all of the root CSS files (editor.css, etc) into your subfolder.
			- These files should have their url() paths modified accordingly. e.g., url(../../img) instead of url(../img)
			- If you're offering nested stylings (/css/styling1/styling2/), styling2 can only be of the "add" type,
			  otherwise it should obviously be set in a top-level folder. (/css/styling2/)
