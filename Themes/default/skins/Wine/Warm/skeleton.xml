<!--
	Layout skeleton. Overrides the theme's $context['skeleton'] variable.
	This file can be ommitted from your skin, in which case it will use
	the equivalent skeleton from the parent skin (or $context['skeleton'] if none is found.)

	The following uses pseudo-HTML to represent the final array.

		- Use <tags></tags> to define layers (functions called as wrappers around other functions)

		- Use <self closing tags /> to define blocks (i.e. straightforward functions)

		- If you have a block that you need to make sure will show up, make sure to specify an array of fallback layers.
		  e.g. wetem::add(array('my_layer', 'sidebar', ''), 'my_block') will try to add 'my_block' to 'my_layer',
		  and if not found, to the sidebar. It will fall back to 'default' (i.e. '') if nothing is found.

		- 'default' is the only required layer. All of the non-wrap layers below are recommended.
		  All blocks are also recommended -- modders will often try to send them data.
		  Rule of thumb: try to keep everything in your own themes and skins!

		- The indent="x" parameter, where x < 0 or x > 0, will indent the layer's content by x tabs.
