		Warnings:
			- If you use "replace", make sure to copy all of the root CSS files (editor.css, etc) into your subfolder.
			- These files should have their url() paths modified accordingly. e.g., url($images) instead of url(../images)
			- If you're offering nested skins (/skins/skin1/skin2/), skin2 can only be of the "add" type,
			  otherwise it should obviously be set in a top-level folder. (/skins/skin2/)

		Layout skeleton. Overrides the theme's $context['skeleton'] variable.
		The following uses pseudo-HTML to represent the final array.

			- Use <tags></tags> to define layers (functions called as wrappers around other functions)

			- Use <self closing tags /> to define blocks (i.e. straightforward functions)

			- If you have a block that you need to make sure will show up, make sure to specify an array of fallback layers.
			  e.g. wetem::add(array('my_layer', 'sidebar', ''), 'my_block') will try to add 'my_block' to 'my_layer',
			  and if not found, to the sidebar. It will fall back to 'default' (i.e. '') if nothing is found.

			- 'default' is the only required layer. All of the non-wrap layers below are recommended.
			  All blocks are also recommended -- modders will often try to send them data.
			  Rule of thumb: try to keep everything in your own themes and skins!

		Code. This section allows you to define extra JavaScript that should be
		added at the end of the page. You can specify a target browser using the
		"for" keyword. You can also require some JavaScript files to be loaded,
		use the "include" keyword to specify a comma-separated list of files.
		They should either use a relative path based on the current theme, or
		the $here variable which acts as an alias to the skin's folder.
		If you use both keywords, use them in this order: for, and include.

		In the examples below, we're applying PNG compatibility fixes to IE6
		(loading the DD_belatedPNG script in the process); we're also allowing
		submit buttons to be styled, and finally we're changing the layout on
		iOS devices to show the sidebar below the main content.
