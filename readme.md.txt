
Welcome to Wedge.
=================

The leading bulletin board/forum/blog software for the new Internet.

Nah, just kidding, it's a pretty innocent package that's hardly going to hit the headlines, ever.
Still, it represents over 3 years of work for two skilled and very dedicated developers.
And it's software to be proud of. Hopefully, it will make your lives a bit less unbearable.

Installing from the GitHub repo
-------------------------------

First, ensure that your server meets the requirements (PHP 5.3, MySQL 5.0.3, etc.)

Go to the `github.com/wedge/wedge` repository.
If you're already there, then hello!

Click the 'Download ZIP' button.
Unzip the file, and upload the resulting folder to your FTP account.
If this is your first time uploading Wedge files, move the contents of the `install` folder
to the root, and point your browser to `http://mywebsite.com/my_wedge_folder/install.php`
Follow the instructions.

If it works, then great. If it doesn't, then skip to any fork that
works best for you. SMF has an official board that lists them all.

Importing data from my old forum
--------------------------------

There is an importer out there, but we're not making it available for now.

What's a 'forum' software?
--------------------------

It's like Facebook, but not for dummies.

Or, for a longer definition: Wedge is basically a Community Management System where you post
messages on boards, and others can reply to them. It's revolutionary. It's the future.
Building your own forum requires some technical skills. If you don't have any, you can still
learn from scratch. I did. If you don't feel up to the task, you can use a hosted forum (can't
help you here), or if you already have some hosting space somewhere, a forum system that will take
you by the hand. Commercial software is okay, but usually doesn't have enough to justify its price
tag. Free (as in beer) forums are legion, with one of the most popular being SMF (Simple Machines
Forum). Once you got used to these, you start asking for more. This is where Wedge comes in.

If you think SMF is pretty good but not ambitious enough for its own sake, then you'll
want to try out its forks. Wedge was the first (started in 2010), and one of a couple of realistic
solutions to use. It basically takes everything that we thought sucked in SMF, and rewrites it
how it should have been from the start.

Of course, your opinion may differ. There's this little thing called 'you can't know without
trying', so here it is, in all its installable glory. You can run Wedge side to side with
another forum system, and determine which one suits you best.

What are you waiting for? Friends to talk with? Well, can't help you here.

What more can you tell me about Wedge?
--------------------------------------

No one can be told you what Wedge really is. You have to read the website for yourself.
Plus, it saves me the hassle. And I'm lazy. See? I can't even come up with my own quotes.

Can you read me my rights?
--------------------------

Read license.txt, and if you don't get all of the legalese, it just means:
- Currently, Wedge is free of charge, but it's not free to redistribute. As such, it's
  not 'free and open source' software, but it's definitely open source.
- You can't redistribute the package by yourself. If you ever find yourself in the need
  to do so, drop me a PM at wedge.org (user name is Nao, it's easy, the guy's everywhere.)
- And other details that most people shouldn't have to bother with. Still, be respectful. Thanks.

There's also license_smf.txt, which basically states that Wedge is based on SMF. Otherwise,
it would have taken 10 years to develop it, not 3. And I do have a life, thank you.
Oh, who am I kidding.
